    <h1>Macarona Bachamel</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>

        and creamy béchamel sauce, and flavorful minced meat. Often compared to lasagna, this dish has its unique
        Egyptian twist, using penne or macaroni pasta and aromatic spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to season the meat
        layer. The dish is assembled with alternating layers of pasta, seasoned meat, and béchamel, then baked to golden
        perfection. Macarona Bechamel is a staple at family gatherings, celebrations, and special occasions in Egypt,
